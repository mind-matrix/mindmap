He was given just his grandfather's first and last name and was not given any middle name. Lincoln's parents were largely uneducated. Later, when Lincoln became more renown, reporters and storytellers often exaggerated the poverty and obscurity of Lincoln's birth. In fact, Lincoln's father Thomas was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December <a href="/wiki/1808" title="1808">1808</a> for $200 cash and assumption of a debt. His parents belonged to a Baptist church that had pulled away from a larger church because they refused to support slavery. Therefore, from a very young age, Lincoln was exposed to anti-slavery sentiment.

Three years after purchasing the property, a prior land claim filed in Hardin Circuit Court forced the Lincolns to move. Thomas continued legal action until he lost the case in 1815. Money spent on the lawsuit contributed to family difficulties. In 1811, they were able to lease 30 acres (0.1 km²) of a 230 acre (0.9 km²) farm on Knob Creek a few miles away, where they then moved. In a valley of the Rolling Fork River, this was some of the best farmland in the area. At this time, Lincoln's father was a respected community member and a successful farmer and carpenter. Lincoln's earliest recollections are from this farm. In 1815, another claimant sought to eject the family from the Knob Creek farm. Frustrated with litigation and lack of security provided by Kentucky courts, Thomas decided to move to <a href="/wiki/Indiana" title="Indiana" relation="visited">Indiana</a>, which had been surveyed by the federal government, making land titles more secure.

Barrymore has continued to be a highly bankable movie actress. Though her playful sex appeal has undoubtedly helped her remain in the media spotlight, she has also established a substantial career behind the scenes, despite never finishing high school. She has produced several films, including the highly successful <i><a href="/wiki/Charlie%27s_Angels_%28film%29" title="Charlie's Angels (film)" relation="opus">Charlie's Angels</a></i> movie adaptation and its sequel. In addition to the light-hearted <a href="/wiki/Romantic_comedy" title="Romantic comedy">romantic comedies</a> that she has typically starred in, she has also recently explored more dramatic roles in movies such as <i><a href="/wiki/Confessions_of_a_Dangerous_Mind" title="Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" relation="opus">Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</a></i>, and the <a href="/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult favorite</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Donnie_Darko" title="Donnie Darko" relation="opus">Donnie Darko</a></i>, of which she was also the executive producer.
